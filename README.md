# AI Nutritionist Chatbot

This is a simple Streamlit-based chatbot designed to act as an AI-powered nutritionist assistant. The chatbot interacts with users, providing personalized nutritional advice, asking questions to understand dietary preferences, health goals, and any specific restrictions. It offers tailored meal plans and shares educational insights about nutrition.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot, you'll need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Configuration

Make sure to set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable or directly in the code (not recommended for production). Update the api_key variable in the code with your OpenAI API key.

python
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"


## Running the Chatbot

To launch the chatbot, run the following command:

bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py


Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python script containing the chatbot code.

## Usage

1. Enter your message in the input box.
2. Click the "Ask" button to submit your query.
3. The chatbot will process the input and provide a relevant response.
4. The chat history and chatbot responses are displayed for reference.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot behavior by modifying the code, adjusting the system messages, or extending the functionality to meet specific requirements.
